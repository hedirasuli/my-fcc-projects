<p class="text">All they need is a single cotton swab of your fingers to see if you are code blooded. Everyone that has been tested says they were nervous about getting the results. Many have opted to delay testing until going through more lessons from PreCodeCamp</p>
<p class="text">When students go to PreCodeCamp first, the result is almost 100%, resulting in being code-blooded. They often found themselves learning quicker and getting jobs that they love. If you're interested in becoming a coding ninja, check out PreCodeCamp's Membership Program</p>
